## Setup & Installation

### Dependencies

Before setting up the project, ensure you have Node.js 18.x and docker/docker-compose installed. 
After cloning the repository, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Make sure you have no local MongoDB and RedisDb are up and running

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start MongoDB and RedisDB containers and expose ports

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the express server in local and the worker will start automatically as well to collect
the data. Currently i have set the worker for 1 minute but it needs to be just once a day for this case.



## Potential Improvements:

Configuration handling with ARG and ENV inside dockerfile instead of static from .env file
Better logging with libraries like Winston
Yaml pipeline for CI/CD
Custom error handling with custom errors functions and middlewares
Worker threads for parallelism
More unit tests and integration tests
